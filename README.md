### Hi there 👋
🔭 I’m currently working on:
 A full-stack application to build a construction Inventory management system that can be used to:
 
  ➡️ get a current picture of inventory
  ➡️ save money
  ➡️ be more efficient with resources
  ➡️ analyze quartely construction project progress 
 
 Stretch Goal: The app will also have a way to manage construciton inventory and manage vehicles.

 Languages to be used:
  - Front end: JavaScript | CSS | HTML
  - API: Java Spring Boot
  - DBMS: MySQL

🪜 Steps taken to build out a full stack application:

    1️⃣ Determine the front-end , API and DMBS tools to be used
    2️⃣ Figure out what entity(ies) along with their attributes to build out
    3️⃣ Build table(s) in MySQL Workbench that shows the columns/attributes and data types (along with the relationship type if there's multiple tables)
